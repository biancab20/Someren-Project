Inholland University of Applied Sciences - Year 1

This small project was a preparation for Project Chapeau. We as a group design the database and application carried by smaller tasks. We learned to use MVC pattern, as well as connecting the database with the application and displaying certain data. We learned how to perform CRUD operations.
